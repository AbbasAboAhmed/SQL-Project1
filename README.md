## About Project 

### The SITUATION
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner
who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he
has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer
seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.

### The OBJECTIVE
 Use MySQL to:
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven
Movies database to answer your potential Acquirerâ€™s questions. Each question will require
you to write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.


### I learn from this project:

1. Write SQL queries to explore and analyze databases with MySQL Workbench.
2. Analyze data across multiple tables with powerful MySQL JOIN statements.
3. Master unique tips and tools.
4. Learn how to use SQL to extract, sort, filter, and group data quickly and efficiently.
